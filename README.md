# EDA-Project

## Project Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hotel bookings to understand booking patterns, customer behaviors, and potential business insights. The primary objective is to analyze booking trends, identify factors affecting booking cancellations, and uncover seasonal and demographic trends to aid in better decision-making.

## Project Objectives
Analyze booking patterns over time.
Identify key factors associated with booking cancellations.
Understand customer segmentation based on demographics and booking characteristics.
Provide visual insights for better data interpretation and business understanding.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains booking details for various hotels. It includes features like:

Hotel: Type of hotel (e.g., city hotel, resort hotel)
IsCanceled: Booking status (canceled or not)
LeadTime: Time between booking and actual stay
ArrivalDateYear, ArrivalDateMonth, ArrivalDateDay: Booking dates
Country: Country of origin of guests
MarketSegment: Segment of booking (e.g., online travel agents, corporate)
Children, Babies: Guest demographics
PreviousCancellations, PreviousBookingsNotCanceled: Past booking behavior
Additional variables detailing stay duration, special requests, meal options, and more.


## Methodology
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values and correct data inconsistencies.
Filter or categorize data for meaningful analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to understand individual features and relationships.
